üìå Project Overview

Sleep disorders such as insomnia, sleep apnea, and narcolepsy affect millions of people worldwide, leading to reduced productivity and health complications. This project applies machine learning techniques to classify and diagnose sleep disorders based on patient health records and lifestyle data.

The aim is to build accurate predictive models that assist in early detection and classification of sleep disorders, enabling better healthcare support.

‚öôÔ∏è Machine Learning Models Used

We experimented with multiple supervised learning algorithms:

  - Na√Øve Bayes (NB)  
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
  - Decision Tree (DT)  
  - Random Forest (RF)  
  - Bagging Classifier  
  - Boosting Techniques (AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, etc.)

üìä Workflow

1. Data Preprocessing
    - Handling missing values
    - Encoding categorical features
    - Feature scaling using StandardScaler

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
    - Distribution of features
    - Correlation analysis
    - Identifying important predictors

3. Model Training & Evaluation
    - Train-test split
    - Model training with different classifiers
    - Evaluation using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, Confusion Matrix

4. Comparison of Models
    - Benchmarking models based on performance metrics
    - Highlighting best-performing algorithm(s)
